# Drone Video Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for drone video assets.

## To Add Your Drone Video:

1. Replace this file with your actual drone video file
2. Name it: `drone-hero-bg.mp4`
3. Recommended specifications:
   - Format: MP4 (H.264)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
   - File size: Under 10MB for optimal web performance

## Alternative Video Sources:

If you don't have drone footage, you can use:
- Stock video from Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay
- Abstract technology videos
- Aerial cityscape footage
- Futuristic/tech-themed backgrounds

## Current Implementation:

The video background is already integrated into the hero section with:
- Proper z-index layering (behind Matrix rain and graphics)
- Responsive overlay for text readability
- Auto-play, loop, and muted settings for web compatibility
- Theme-aware overlay colors (dark/light mode support)

The video will automatically display once you add the `drone-hero-bg.mp4` file to this directory.
